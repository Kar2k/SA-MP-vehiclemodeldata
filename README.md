# SA-MP VEHICLE MODEL DATA
## Extracted vehicle model data.

Allows you to use functions such as "modelMass" which is the same as "GetVehicleModelMass".

It uses a "vehModel" syntax due to function names being long such as "vehModelSuspensionHghSpdDamping" (HghSpd means High Speed).

This data is from the handling.cfg file. This is not handling data, but it is model data about each vehicle.

Vehicle model ABS data was not included.
